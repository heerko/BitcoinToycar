# BitcoinToycar

The processing sketch loads the value (actually the price of one bitcoin in Euros) from https://blockchain.info/nl/tobtc?currency=EUR&value=1
The sketch connects to our toy car over serial and sends an 'A' if the value goes up, an 'B' if it goes down causing the car to go either forward & left or forward & right.
