# BitcoinToycar

This processing sketch loads the bitcoin value from https://api.bitcoinaverage.com/ticker/global/EUR/
The sketch connects to an Arduino connected RC toy car over serial and sends an 'A' if the value goes up, an 'B' if it goes down causing the car to go either forward & left or forward & right, thus visualising the bitcoin course over time.
